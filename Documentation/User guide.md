You are taken to a view where you can manage your survey. The main elements of a survey are categories, answers and results. It's recommended to create the categories first, as they are needed when creating questions. 

### Create and edit categories

Categories are the different areas within the survey topic that your survey will assess. To start creating categories, click "Add category".

Give your category a name and a description and click "Save".

Once a category is created, you can add category results (a short assessment on how the person answering the survey scored in this area) and content links (links to further resources on the subject). To add a content link, fill in the type and url of the resource and click "Add". You can add multiple content links to a category.

To edit the category itself or the content links, do the changes and click "Save". You can also delete any of the content links in this view.

To create and edit category results, click "Manage category results". Each category result includes a result text and a cutoff value. The cutoff value is the maximum score in this category that will give this result. For example, if the cutoff values are set at 0.5 and 1.0, the results will be returned at 0-50 % and 50-100% of the maximum category score, respectively.

A category result at cutoff value 1.0 is automatically created, and the cutoff value of this result cannot be edited. This is to ensure there is always at least one category result applicable to any score.

Save your changes by clicking "Save changes".

NB: When deleting category results, remember to save any other changes made to the results before deleting a result.
