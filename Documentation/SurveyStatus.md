# Survey status
Surveys are complex and feature many different fields of information. To ensure that users create surveys that work in the survey application, Super Admin 3000 features a survey status functionality. Each survey has a status. The status can be one of the following three:
- All Good (green): The survey will function correctly in the survey application
- Warning (yellow): The survey will function in the survey application, but it has small defects.
- Attention required (red): The survey will not function in the survey application, and it could possibly break the application.

## Warning
The warning status indicates that the survey has some defects. The survey will not break the survey application, but the defects should be addressed. Warning status is displayed when:
- Questions that do not affect any category
