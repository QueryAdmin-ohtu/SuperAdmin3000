# Survey status
Surveys are complex and feature many different fields of information. To ensure that users create surveys that work in the survey application, Super Admin 3000 features a survey status functionality. Each survey features a status. The status can be one of the following three:
- All Good (green): The survey will function correctly in the survey application
- Warning (yellow): The survey will function in the survey application, but it has small defects.
- Attention required (red): The survey will not function in the survey application, and it could possibly break the application.
